	<!--	 First step of this mod:
 * Heat dissipated by heat sinks is a constant known as ShipCombatManager.HeatPushMult, every heatVentTick of the heatsink/radiator.
 * however, as of 09/07/20, ShipCombatManager is protected from external access due to the internal visibility.
 * Updates to this value WILL NEED manual update, until ShipCombatManager becomes public.
 *
 * we add this value to heatsink and radiators xml (ir any new heat management building), as it should already be the case. -->
